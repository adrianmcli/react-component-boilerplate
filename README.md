# React Component Boilerplate

Basic component boilerplate.

### How-to

`$ npm install`

`$ npm run dev`

navigate to `localhost:8080`

### Considerations

You might want to tune `.babelrc` and `webpack.config` based on your needs.


### Why's

- Why not to use npm scripts over webpack CLI to run a dev server? — [that's why](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/106)

- Why so fancy import works `import Component from Component`? — checkout the aliases in webpack config.
